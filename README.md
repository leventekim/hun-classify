# hun-classify
The aim of this project is to create embeddings of old and new Hungarian texts and try to classify them as such using various classification techniques.

The results are reproducible by running scripts/1_hun_classifier.ipynb as the data is available in the data folder.

The total runtime using an ASUS ZenBook (CPU) with a 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-1135G7 @ 2.40GHz (2.42 GHz) processor was approximately 3.5 minutes.
